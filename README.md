# My portfolio

Tools used to build this website:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) - you can host any static website (HTML, CSS, JS) really easily using GitHub, totally for free!
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) - a super handy CSS framework to get Google's Material Design components and style
- And a bunch of custom CSS to get it looking just right.

## Note
- Make sure to set `analyticsId` to your unique GA account id inside the `Google Analytics` script tag at the bottom of the `<body>`, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
